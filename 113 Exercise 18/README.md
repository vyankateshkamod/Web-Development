You have to use an API and display tha data in the form of a card under a container . All the data points returned by the API should be converted to a card 
Use this API : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Hint : Create a state for a data where a data can be fetched using the json placeholder API 
Inside use effect , use fetch to populate that state and use map to render the cards from the state
